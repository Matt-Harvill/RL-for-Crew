### Dev Notes
- Check on how implementing rules
    - make sure players can always play a sub
    - add feature for letting players pick their tasks
- Display more info on players (probably good to just have a \_\_str\_\_ method for game and player objects)
- Display more informative errors if entering wrong info
- Add checking for complete tasks and impossible tasks
